# Azure Identity & Access Management (IAM)

## Objective
Implement secure identity and access management in Azure using Microsoft Entra ID and role-based access control (RBAC) by applying least-privilege access principles.

## Tools & Services Used
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory)
- Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Azure Subscription IAM

## Architecture
User → Security Group → RBAC Role → Azure Subscription

## Implementation Steps
1. Created Azure AD users for access testing
2. Created a security group and added users
3. Assigned Reader RBAC role at subscription level
4. Validated least-privilege access design

## Security Best Practices Applied
- Least privilege access
- Group-based role assignment
- Centralized identity management
- Reduced attack surface

## Outcome
Successfully implemented secure Azure IAM configuration aligned with cloud security best practices.
